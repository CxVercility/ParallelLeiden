# ParallelLeiden

WARNING: It's come to my attention that my implementation may be able to produce disconnected communities (see https://arxiv.org/html/2312.13936v5) hinting at some sort of implementation error.
I can not confirm (nor deny) these results so please make sure to either test yourself if this is important to you.

ParallelLeiden is a parallelized implementation of the Leiden algorithm

NetworKit is needed for this code to work, just place the entire folder in the same directory as the PL files

Hint: As of version 9.1.1 this algorithm is included in networkit itself.
